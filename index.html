        <h1>Importance of touch typing</h1>
        <p><strong>Touch typing</strong> is a technique that helps you type faster and more efficiently by using all your fingers.
        Typing with this technique is important because it can greatly improve your productivity, especially
        if you have a type-intensive job, like a programmer or a writer.</p>
        <p>Using this technique allows you to create a structure on where you have to place different fingers
        on specific areas on your keyboard. </p>
        <p>You are using all your 10 fingers, and each one is in charge of a section or a column on the keyboard.
        And it all starts with the <strong>Home Row.</strong></p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why there are little bumps on the "F" and "J" keys? That's for you to figure out if your index fingers
        are on the home row or not.</p>

        <p>Starting from the home row, every finger is assigned a section on the keyboard, like in the image below.</p>

        <h2>Common mistakes when touch typing</h2>

        <p>There are some mistakes that people are doing when learning how to touch type and we’ll go briefly through the most popular ones. </p>
        <p>The most common one is crossing your fingers on the letters “Y” and “B”.
            For the “Y”, you should always use the right-hand index finger, but some people are used to pressing it with the other index.</p>
        <p>The same thing happens with “B” where you are supposed to press it with your left-hand index finger but it’s commonly pressed with your right index.</p>
        <p>The second most common mistake when learning how to touch type is using the wrong side modifiers.</p>
        <p>If for example, you want to press “Shift” + “A”, you should use the right-hand shift, instead of the left one.</p>
        <p>The reason you should learn to use the modifiers on both sides appropriately becomes more obvious when you have to press more complex strings of keys,
            like “Ctrl” + “Alt” + “A”. If you were to press all the keys on your left side, you will force your hand in a weird position that will slow you down.
            In this case, you should use “Ctrl” and “Alt” from the right side of the keyboard and press A with your left.</p>

        <h2>Learning to touch type</h2>
        <p>Now that we learned what touch typing is, let's move on to how to actually develop this important skill</p>
        <p>The most important thing in your learning process is to <strong>learn the technique first</strong>, and let the speed come naturally afterward.
        If you are rushing through it, it won't work. Take your time and do it properly. </p>

        <p>Curve your fingers a little and put them on the ASDF and JKL; keys which are located in the middle row of the letter keys. The
        <strong>Home row</strong> is important because you will always start from these keys and always return to them.</p>
        <p>Don't look at the keys when you type. Just slide your fingers around until they find the home row marking.</p>
        <p>Limit your hand and finger movement only to what is necessary to press a specific key.
        Keep your hands and fingers close to the base position.
        This improves typing speed and reduces stress on the hands.</p>
        <p>Pay attention to ring fingers and little fingers, since they are considerably underdeveloped.</p>

        <h2>Proper Typing Posture</h2>
        <p>With a majority of careers now requiring significant time behind the computer, ensuring that you have proper typing posture is more important than ever.
            However, typing posture is so much more than just the placement of your fingers; appropriate typing posture involves your entire body from the placement of your feet to the height of your computer monitor.
            Below we will touch on every element of proper typing posture – including equipment and tools you should be using to improve your typing workflow.</p>

        <p><strong>Proper Typing Posture entails:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your feet flat on the ground and your neck and back straight.</li>
            <li>Adjusting your elbows to an angle between 90 and 110 degrees.</li>
            <li>Keeping your wrists in a neutral stance.</li>
            <li>Moving your monitor so that the top of your screen is at eye-level.</li>
            <li>Adding appropriate ergonomic typing accessories.</li>
        </ul>
